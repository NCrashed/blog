<p>The heavy work under my <a href="http://ncrashed.github.io/blog/posts/2016-06-12-hsoc-acceptance.html">HSOC project</a> has begun. The first and the most important point in my plan is implementation of RTS API for following actions with the eventlog subsystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Redirecting event stream to user specified file descriptor.</p></li>
<li><p>Piping all events via memory into the Haskell side.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic resizing of internal buffers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The patched GHC repo is located <a href="https://github.com/NCrashed/ghc">here</a> and the current Haskell side repo is <a href="https://github.com/NCrashed/live-profile-monitor">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design-choices">Design choices</h2>
<p>To get data from RTS side about occured events one can imagine three different approaches.</p>
<h3 id="substitution-of-file-descriptor">Substitution of file descriptor</h3>
<p>The idea is simple, user specifies own file descriptor as sink for the eventlog. The most easiest solution to implement, but has some caveats.</p>
<p>Firstly, you will ultimately skip initial events that carry very important info about capability sets, program arguments and spawned threads. The events are spawned before the main thread starts, so you cannot redirect the events to custom sink. The caveat could be workarounded by force flushing the default eventlog file and reading the initial events from it.</p>
<p>Secondly, one should use memory pipes represented as a file descriptor (<code>FILE*</code> actually), that is quite platform dependent. POSIX systems can use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/mkfifo">mkfifo(3)</a> and Windows has its own <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365590(v=vs.85).aspx">NamesPipes</a>. And finally, I quickly hit an issue when RTS blocks on writing to the pipe (created with <code>mkfifo</code>) as reader thread in Haskell side was slower than writer on the RTS side.</p>
<p>Despite the problems I encountered, the file descriptor substitution API that I implemented is still useful for temporal eventlog disabling (setting <code>NULL</code> as descriptor) and for simple tasks like redirecting the events to non-standard file.</p>
<h3 id="making-arbitrary-hook-on-data-dumping">Making arbitrary hook on data dumping</h3>
<p>It is the most flexible solution one can imagine as user can do anything with the data passed into the hook. But after some brainstorming of call sequence I realized that the approach is likely to cause deadlocks.</p>
<p>Let’s say we made a Haskell hook that writes to some memory buffer or socket. During the action a GC or other events might occur that can overflow an internal buffer. Global eventlog sink is protected by a mutex that is kept when we enters the hook callback, and the hook will provoke another eventlog dump that tries to acquire lock of the mutex again. Despite the fact of double locking of the mutex there would be possible infinite recursive call of the hook as each callback call can provoke the eventlog dumping.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/eternal_hooking.png#center" />

</div>
<p>I was playing around with the hook implementations and found another source of problems. If the hook contains internal foreign calls the RTS will crash with <code>reentered to scheduler</code> error. The problem can be easyly hit by using POSIX memory pipes as they require some foreign calls.</p>
<p>The only safe way of using such hook is use it only from C code or any other language that cannot produce new eventlog messages. I decided to remove the hooking API from RTS when superseding design was implemented. It was simply too dangerous to use.</p>
<h3 id="storing-in-memory">Storing in memory</h3>
<p>The most complicated solution when RTS has its own extendible memory buffer to store eventlog data until Haskell side not consume it. The tricky part is maintaining of memory usage, the method I designed is shown on the picture below. RTS keeps a linked list of memory blobs where new events are pushed to tail and the Haskell side pops out the head of buffer.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/chunked_buffer.png#center" />

</div>
<p>The solution is portable and has advantage in reusing of memory of popped chunks. I create a bytestring from the buffer without copying from the popped chunked. So I have sticked to the solution as good enough.</p>
<p>The buffer is created and used only when special RTS flag <code>-lm</code> is set to prevent occasional memory exhaustion when nobody pops the log head.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-about-reallocation">The story about reallocation</h2>
<p>I have run into numerous segfaults on my way to operational design with dynamically sized buffers. The main reason of segfaults was that not all eventlog operations are protected by mutexes. As each capability has its own buffer, there is no need for locking that is very expensive. The diagram of data flow is presented below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/rts_eventlog.png#center" />

</div>
<p>I successfully designed a solution when no additional locks are needed. The Haskell side posts only a request for resize and actual resizing is performed by the capability that owns a buffer being resized. Now user can control granularity of live logging as smaller buffers will flush frequently.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-side">Haskell side</h2>
<p>Currently Haskell side library for live monitor simply prints results of incremental parsing of the eventlog piped from chunked buffer. Thanks a lot to Karl Velicka for amazing <a href="https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/13">PR</a> with incremental parser for <code>ghc-events</code>!</p>
<p>My next goal is entention of the library to support TCP/UDP protocol for communication with future live profiler client. There is important constituent part of eventlog state management that have to support connecting and disconnecting clients at arbitrary time.</p>
