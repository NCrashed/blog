I am curious haskeller and have just finished my six year education in BMSTU. Also I have three years of Haskell experience including one year of production experience.

The blog was initially created to publish my progress in [Haskell Summer of Code 2016](https://summer.haskell.org/>), but I am intended to post my Haskell investigations further after the end of hsoc.
